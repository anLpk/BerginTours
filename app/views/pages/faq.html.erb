          <p>TURKEY TOURS COMPANY products can only be booked online or over the phone. 
            It is recommended you pre book your travel services to avoid disappointment 
            as many of the tours and products are popular, and can be sold out early. 
            If you wish to wait and book at the destination, you can do this, but we would like 
            to remind you that last minute bookings (last 3 days before the departure date of the services) 
            can not be done online.</p>

          <p>Reconfirming 24 hours in advance is mandatory with some travel products, 
          and recommended for others. Please refer to the instructions on the service voucher for details. 
          If you will not be arriving at the destination in time to reconfirm within 24 hours, please 
          reconfirm with the tour operator prior to this time as departure times and locations may vary 
          slightly. It is highly recommended you receive this up to date confirmation directly from the 
          tour operator prior to departure. All relevant details and contact numbers can be found at the 
          bottom of the service voucher.</p>
